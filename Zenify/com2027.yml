project_name: ZENIFY

project_description: |
  Zenify is a project which aims to promote a healthy work environment. It satisfies three SDGs:
  3 (Good Health & Wellbeing), 8 (Decent Work & Economic Growth), 10 (Reduced Inequality). Our 
  website provides well-rounded support by having employees undergo a lifestyle and personality 
  assessment to match them with similar employees so they can connect with each other and alleviate 
  stress from work-life balance. A dashboard presented on the homepage will display daily reminders 
  to each employee specifying the wellbeing activities they can practise, based on their assessment 
  at the start. As they go, they are able to track their wellbeing progress.
